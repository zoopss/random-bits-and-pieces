_Mutable data types_ are those which can be edited **in place**. By **in place**, we mean that the entries inside the particular datatype can be edited without creating a copy or overwriting the previous value. _Immutable data types_ are those which do not fall in the above category.

Examples:**Mutable Data Types** : _List,Dictionaries_
